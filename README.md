# No Theme for Oxygen

This theme only serves as a placeholder for sites built with [Oxygen](http://oxygenbuilder.com/).

Oxygen completely disables the WordPress theme system, so it really doesn't matter which theme you have installed.

However, theme update notifications will still come through for any themes that are installed while using Oxygen. It can be annoying (and confusing for clients).

This 'No Theme' solves two problems..

1. No more theme update notifications (assuming this is the only theme installed)
2. Gives Oxygen user the opportunity to leave contact details for the next developer that may take on the project.

## Installation ##

1. [Download the theme here.](https://github.com/wplit/no-theme/archive/master.zip)
2. Go to Themes > Add New in your WordPress admin. Click on `Upload Theme` and browse for the zip file.
3. Activate the Theme.
4. Replace stylesheet header found in theme to include your own contact details.
